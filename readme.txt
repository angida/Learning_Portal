After doing that we can see that the master branch shown in the 
VSCode[bottom left corner] is now changed to the branch name that

Step-5 : Commit Changes

Now let me create a new file called as newfile.txt in my branch. 
After writing down the code/text in that file click on the git icon 
in VSCode side bars.
